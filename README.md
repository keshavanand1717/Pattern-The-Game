# Sequence-The-Game
A game developed to challenge your memory.

I have used HTML,CSS,JavaScript and jQuery to develop this game as a website.

Here is how to play the game:-

1)Press any key to Start.

2)At each Level you will see a button "flash".

3)At each level you have to click all the buttons which have flashed from Level 1 up to your current level in the sequence they flashed.

4)So at each level, number of buttons to be clicked = Your current level.

5)If at any point you press a button not in the correct sequence then your game ends and you can start over by pressing any key.

So, at every level you have to remember the sequence in which the buttons flashed at the begining of each level. 

Try it out it's fun.
